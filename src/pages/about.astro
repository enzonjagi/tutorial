    <h2>...and my new Astro site</h2>
    <p>

        page on my site.
    </p>
    <p>Let's do this and more.</p>

    <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
        <li>
            I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}.
        </li>
        {
            identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && (
                <li>
                    Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and{" "}
                    {identity.hobbies[1]}
                </li>
            )
        }
    </ul>
    <p>My skills are:</p>
    <ul>
        {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>
    {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}

    {finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}

    {(<p>My goal is to finish in {goal} day(s).</p>)}
